In the nodes/ folder you can define your nodes.
You can see for example kamailio_nodes.pp, which contains a generic node, and a node I use for testing on a VM.
After you've defined a node, which could be as simple as:

node { 'my_hostname' : 
  class { 'kamailio': }
}

you apply the configuration with this command (to be applied from puppet-kamailio/ folder):

PATH/puppet-kamailio$ udo puppet apply -v environments/test/manifests/site.pp --modulepath modules/:/etc/puppet/modules/ --show_diff --noop

Note the 'test' environment.
'--noop' provides a dry run. Remove it to apply for real the configuration.
'--show_diff' tells puppet to show what's being changed.

Refer to the main README in puppet-kamailio for examples on how to use configuration items.

Please raise an Issue on github for any request/concern you may have.
